Creating an entire webpage from the beginning

This is for the Odin Projects "Foundations Course" and consists of building an entire webpage from scratch, applying all previous lessons about html and css.
The basic desgin is provided by the course instructions, although I am encouraged to be creative and experiment with certain stylistic aspects of the page.

Update 03.04.23: The website is finished according to the core instructions given by the project. I might add some personal touches at my leisure in the future.
