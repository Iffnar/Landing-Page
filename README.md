Creating an entire webpage from the beginning

This is a project from the Odin Projcts "Foundations Course" and consists of building an entire webpage from scratch, applying all previous lessons about html and css.
The basic desgin is provided by the course instructions, although I am encouraged to be creative and experiment with certain stylistic aspects of the page.
